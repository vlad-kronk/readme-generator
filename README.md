## Description

As a University of Washington Coding Boot Camp student, I want to further my back-end development knowledge by using Node to run a console application that generates a professional README markdown file based on a user's input. I built this to make it easier for me and other developers to format a README using a template. This README generator makes it so developers can focus on the content of the readme without worrying about styling and formatting their markdown document.

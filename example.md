## Description

As a University of Washington Coding Boot Camp student, it is my motivation to better my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to prepare for future career opportunities. This project was my first from-scratch web app. It helped me better understand the fundamentals of web design: how to allow the structure, style, and interactivity to work together to create a viable product. This project is a short, timed, multiple-choice quiz that locally saves the users' scores.
